              <p>San Diego, CA – May 13, 2014  – Genoa Pharmaceuticals, the leader in inhaled medicines for pulmonary fibrosis, announced today that it will participate in the scientific discussion focusing on fibrotic disease during the American Thoracic Society International Conference (ATS 2014) in San Diego, CA, May 16 – 21. Data will highlight research conducted with inhaled GP-101 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Genoa's abstract can be accessed through the ATS website, http://conference.thoracic.org/2014/. The data will remain under embargo until the date and time that the data are presented (details below).</p>

              <h2 class="h3 margin-top--large">About GP-101</h2>
              <p>Pirfenidone has been shown to moderately slow IPF disease progression. Unfortunately, substantial side effects associated with the oral product prevent further dose escalation for maximum effect. Complicating matters, suggested dose-absorbing food, first-pass metabolism, and safety-driven dose-reduction and stoppage protocols further reduce lung dose and interrupt desired daily therapy. GP-101 is being developed to address these shortcomings and maximize pirfenidone’s therapeutic potential. Administered by inhalation, preclinical data suggest ~160-fold less GP-101 will deliver the same peak human lung dose and effect as the oral medicine. With much less drug required for this equivalence, oral-related side effects are expected to be minimized. With fewer side effects, the inhaled GP-101 dose will be escalated to maximize IPF efficacy. In addition to serving as a highly-compliant and improved-effect IPF therapy, as a low-side effect product, inhaled GP-101 may also enable pirfenidone’s use in otherwise poorly-tolerated or unsafe combination regimens.</p>
