<!--
Add vendor CSS and JS init calls here.
This is loaded as an .html import to <app-shell> so that Polymer
can control these dependencies (prevents script loading de-duplication, etc.)

If you are initing a JS lib that requires targeting elements directly,
you will need to run your init code AFTER the partial is loaded to the DOM
(see _initVendorCode() method in app-shell.html - Init code you add here is added after the $WRAPPER.appendChild() call)
NOTE: you may need to querySelect the target elements again since they were loaded to the DOM after app-shell loaded,
NOTE: thus the idea of 'hyrdating', or re-binding, the new DOM code with existing code in window.

<!-- HIGHTLIGHT.JS -->
<!-- This example inits the hightlight.js library so you can syntax-highlight <pre><code> examples -->
<!-- We manually 'hydrate' the added DOM code when each new partial is loaded -->
<!-- See the hljs.highlightBlock(block) init call in _initVendorCode() in /src/app-shell.html -->
